This resposiory contains code for a streamlit app that can be used as a learning resource when demonstrating frequency analysis.

## Example usage

1. Open the streamlit app (see button above for link).
2. Enter some plain text in the first text area.
3. Note the uneven distribution, some letters are more common than others.
4. Enter encrypted text in the second text area. Create encrypted text using a Caesar cipher: https://ciphereditor.com/explore/caesar-cipher.
5. Note the underlying distribution is the same and comment on weakness of Caesar cipher.
6. Enter alternative encrypted text in the second text area. Create encrypted text using a Polyalphabetic cipher: https://ciphereditor.com/explore/vigenere-cipher.
7. Note how the underlying distribution is different. Compare and contrast to the Caesar cipher.
